##This project is a small project to refresh my skills within python environments that would benefit me in the managing of my own expenses.

To start off, the project will simply be a data entry tool for expenses made month by month. Hopefully I will eventually have it set up for monthly payments and loans for when they are being paid.

The first goal in mind is to have an in depth entry process for expenses specifically:
-When they were made, MM/DD/YYYY and there will be buckets based for each month
-How much was the expense
-How was it paid CC/DC/Cash
-What is it considered? Entertainment/Food/Gas/etc

There will also be a prediction/goal for expenses to be set so that you as an end user can establish a limit to how much you want to spend and predict it month by month

The application will simply add up per month and see if that limit has been reached and how much is it off by

Lastly the final ability would be to export the data saved within a CSV file for use in data analysis, maybe the data analysis could be done within this application but for now an export of it will be done

The data will be stored within Google Firebase as a noSQL server for quick and easy access.
